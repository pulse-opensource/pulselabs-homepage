					Hi boys. I'm Tina. Please don't tell Mom and Dad. So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make out?' And I make out with it. I'm out of control. Everything I know to be true just went out the
					window. This is such a snore-gasm. I guess she doesn't like wearing clothes. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. Argh!... Wait, I like the library.
				</div>

				<div>
					Your ass is grass and I'm gonna mow it. I need to find a boy with a turtle bite on his finger. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know where bagels go. I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. Dr. Yap is dreamy.
					When he's looking at my molars, it's like he's looking into my soul. I guess she doesn't like wearing clothes. YOU GORGEOUS IDIOT! And I'm gonna read it to the whole school myself.
				</div>

				<div>
					The hand wants what the hand wants. If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! Drop the towel. Drop the towel. Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life. If I drunk text you and you're asleep, don't text me in the morningâ€¦that ship has
					sailed. Follow me fellas...Lets go somewhere where the sixteen of us can be alone. Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life.
